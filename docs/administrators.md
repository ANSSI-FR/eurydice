# üöÄ Deployment in production and administration

Instructions to deploy Eurydice manually are available below.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Manual deployment with docker compose

- `compose.yml` allows for launching a local development environment
  - ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
- `compose.prod.yml` allows for launching the origin or destination production stack

  1.  Configure the environment variables ([more details below](#Ô∏è-environment-variables))
  2.  Create the directories configured in the environment variables
  3.  Set permissions to allow read/write access to these directories for the UID configured in the environment variables

  **If you don't need elk logging:**

  4.  Configure the database by applying the migrations:
      - Origin:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --profile origin run --rm db-migrations-origin
        ```
      - Destination (on another machine):
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --profile destination run --rm db-migrations-destination
        ```
  5.  Launch the stack:

      - Origin:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --profile origin up -d
        ```
      - Destination (on another machine):
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --profile destination up -d
        ```

  **If you want elk logging:**

  4.  Configure the database by applying the migrations:
      - Origin:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --profile origin-with-elk-logging run --rm db-migrations-origin-with-elk
        ```
      - Destination (on another machine):
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --profile destination-with-elk-logging run --rm db-migrations-destination-with-elk
        ```
  5.  Launch the stack:

      - Origin:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --profile origin-with-elk-logging up -d
        ```
      - Destination (on another machine):
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml --profile destination-with-elk-logging up -d
        ```
      - Note: Additional environment variables are needed: see the list below. You will need an API key:
        [more details below](#elasticsearch-api-key).

  **Optional admin user**

  6.  (optional) Create an administrator user for accessing the admin interface at `/admin` (default credentials are admin/admin)
      - Origin:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml exec backend-origin make superuser
        ```
      - Destination (on another machine):
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.prod.yml exec backend-destination make superuser
        ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

The `.env` file should be placed in the directory from which you are running `docker compose` (usually next to the `compose.yml` file).
You can also name the file as you wish [and point compose to it using the `--env-file` flag](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#using-the---env-file--option).

The following environment variables should be configured for the deployment (variables without a default value are mandatory):

| Variable                                    | Default value                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Warning: make sure that `DBTRIMMER_TRIM_TRANSFERABLES_AFTER` is greater than `TRANSFERABLE_HISTORY_DURATION`.**
If `DBTRIMMER_TRIM_TRANSFERABLES_AFTER` is less than `TRANSFERABLE_HISTORY_DURATION`, the DBTrimmer on the destination side will remove transferables that the history from the origin will recreate.
This will lead to previously deleted transferables being marked as `ERROR` on the destination side.

### History management

In some cases, the origin-side database may end up holding millions of Transferable entries. Combined with a long history duration, this may lead to the sender generating enormous quantities of data, just to send the history.

If that happens, you may want to consider using a much smaller history duration, while keeping the same `DBTRIMMER_TRIM_TRANSFERABLES_AFTER`. This will allow you to manually ask the sender to send a complete history only when needed, with the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml exec sender python manage.py send_history --duration 7days
```

## üë§ UID, GID and bind mounts

The `PUID` and `PGID` variables must have read/write permissions on the directories defined in the other variables.

### Storing data

If `MINIO_ENABLED` is false, Eurydice will attempt to use the filesystem as storage, instead of a remote s3 storage server. `TRANSFERABLE_STORAGE_DIR` should be set to the path to a directory.

### Logging

If `LOG_TO_FILE` is true, Eurydice will write additional logs at `${PYTHON_LOGS_DIR}/<service>-logs/log.json`. This is useful when using a `-with-elk-logging` profile, so that filebeat may read, process and share applicative logs to a remote elk server.

## üñ•Ô∏è Reverse Proxy

Eurydice needs to be setup behind a reverse proxy to work securely and optimally.
Setting up a reverse proxy will also enable authentication at the reverse proxy level rather than relying on the application's authentication mechanism.

The application's services are exposed on `localhost` by the `compose.prod.yml`.
It is advised to route them like so:

- Web UI at `http://localhost:8888`
  - Should handle requests who don't match the rules for the services below
- API at `http://localhost:8080`
  - Should handle requests whose path is prefixed by `/api` `/admin` `/static`
- Minio at `http://localhost:9000`
  - Should handle requests whose path is prefixed by `/minio` (the `/minio` prefix should be removed by the reverse proxy)
- pgadmin at `http://localhost:5050`
  - Should handle requests whose path is prefixed by `/pgadmin` (the `/pgadmin` prefix should be removed by the reverse proxy)
  - The reverse proxy should only allow authenticated users on this endpoint as all pgadmin authentication is disabled

The reverse proxy should also serve all endpoints over TLS.
It should also set the `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers to forward information from the original request to the services.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security risks associated with HTTP header authentication

**Warning: [django normalizes HTTP headers](https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releases/1.6.10.html#wsgi-header-spoofing-via-underscore-dash-conflation). So it is important to make sure that a user cannot forge an authentication HTTP header that would be considered safe by the reverse proxy, but would in fact be normalized by Django into a valid authentication header**

This risk can be mitigated by configuring which header is used for authenticating the header with the `REMOTE_USER_HEADER` variable.
This environment variable could for example be set to a purely alphanumeric value (not affected by normalization) which could not easily be guessed by the user.
In such a scenario, one would still need to make sure that the reverse proxy correctly prevents users from submitting their own authentication header.

### üõ£Ô∏è Basic authentication

**Warning: Basic HTTP authentication passes your credentials over the network as clear text. As such, it is NOT the recommended method of authentication. If you need to run Eurydice using basic auth, at least use HTTPS.**

In case you are unable to setup a reverse proxy and remote user authentication, Eurydice may support [Basic HTTP Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme).

Basic HTTP Authentication is enabled when the `REMOTE_USER_HEADER_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED` variable is set to `false`.

### Elasticsearch API key

To send applicative logs into an ELK you need an API key for a user with following role restrictions:

```
{
  "filebeat_writer": {
    "cluster": ["monitor", "read_ilm", "read_pipeline"],
    "index": [
      {
        "names": ["eurydice-*"],
        "privileges": ["view_index_metadata", "create_doc", "auto_configure"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
