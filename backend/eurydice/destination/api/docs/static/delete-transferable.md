Delete an incoming transferable, that is, remove a received file and its transfer information.
This is **not** done automatically after retrieving the transferable.

**Deleting transferables after retrieving them is recommended**, especially if they are large (> 100MB): it saves up space for other users as well as for your future transfers.
Please note that Eurydice does not allow for long-term file storage. Transferred files are automatically deleted after a period of time.
Nonetheless, manual deletion is recommended to prevent congestion.
