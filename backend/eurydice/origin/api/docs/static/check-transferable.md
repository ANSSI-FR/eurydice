This endpoint returns information about an outgoing transferable, including its transfer status.
If the status is still ONGOING, the progress percentage and the estimated time of arrival tell you about ongoing operations.

You may notice that the estimated time of arrival changes from one transferable to another or even in the middle of a given transfer.
It is because it takes into account other users and their bandwidth consumption in real time.
